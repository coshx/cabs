    %ol.rules
      %li
        Collect as much cab fare as you can in 60 sec.
      %li
        Click on a car to destroy it and collect its fare.
      %li
        The further a car has gone, the higher the fare will be. Cars with high fares will have more green dots.
      %li
        Lyf's will give you the most money, then Bers, then BerXs.
      %li
        If two cars collide, they will both explode without giving you the fare.
      %li
        Watch out! You'll lose money if a passenger is dropped off and you haven't crushed the car!
