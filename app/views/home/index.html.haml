      The Taxi Cab Unions of New York City are not happy with new companies disrupting their market. They've hired you to take satellite guns and destroy their competition.

        You have 60 seconds to collect as MUCH money as you can! <br>
        Click on a car to destroy it and collect its fare. <br>
        Mouse over a car to view its route on the map. <br>
        The further a car has traveled, the higher its fare will be. <br>
        Use the green dots to identify cars with high fares. <br>
        Wait until a car accumulates a high fare before clicking! <br>
        But watch out: if a car reaches its destination, youâ€™ll lose money.
